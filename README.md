🎓 I’m a cybersecurity student currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity** from **Riphah International University**. I'm in my **3rd semester** and expect to graduate in **2028**.

🛡️ With certifications like **eJPTv2**, **PT1**, and the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, I’ve built a strong foundation in real-world cybersecurity practices. I created this blog to document my journey, share research, and provide valuable insights for others learning in this field.

✍️ Whether it’s breaking down complex topics or sharing tutorials, my goal is to contribute to the growing cybersecurity community and help others learn along the way.

🧠 I enjoy working on:
- CTFs & Reverse Engineering  
- Web & Network Penetration Testing  
- Tool Development for Cybersecurity  
- Writing Blogs and Technical Content
